//Other than relying on the linkname reallocation directive, the below function also
//relies on the fact that there are no "true" methods in Go, they're all functions where the first
//arg is the "method" receiver ðŸ˜‰ this is how "method expression/values" and other functional features
//in Go work. For some reason logrus doesn't expose the releaseEntry method, only the NewEntry one.
